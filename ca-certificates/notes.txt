Define vcpkg baseline: vcpkg consistent, additional guarantee of consistent builds:
vcpkg x-update-baseline --add-initial-baseline

vcpkg for cross-compiling to embedded targets (especially because of curl dependency): https://opencoursehub.cs.sfu.ca/bfraser/grav-cms/cmpt433/links/files/2024-student-howtos/Cross-compiling_External_C_C++LibrariesUsing_vcpkg.pdf

Each build preset (under buildPresets) and test preset (under testPresets) has a "configurePreset": it means run only if the corresponding configure preset has been previously executed.

The goal is to build as fast as possible:
- clang instead of gcc
- ninja instead of make 
- 8 parallel jobs to for building
